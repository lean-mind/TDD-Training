## Introduction

All the exercises/Katas can be done using the following templates located on our public GitHub:

[lean-mind/coding-dojo-templates (github.com)](https://github.com/lean-mind/coding-dojo-templates)

In order to provide the best experience and feedback, the exercises should be done in Python or TypeScript, whatever the attendees prefer. Variable and function names should be written in English for the same reason. The README.md explains how to create your repository for each exercise just clicking the ðŸš€Â icon.

(During the following days we will upgrade the templates to the latest version and guarantee that on Monday everything will work perfectly.)

We have considered many exercises based on your requirements. We believe that the following will cover all the necessary principles of TDD:

2. [String Calculator](./2-exercise/README.md)
3. [Word Wrap](./3-exercise/README.md)

4. [User Signup API](5-exercise/README.md)
5. [Surveillance System](6-exercise/README.md)
